                    <p>The insured company operates from two expansive manufacturing facilities characterized by highly automated processes. Given their substantial reliance on operational technology, it became imperative to undertake a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) initiative. This undertaking aimed to pinpoint vulnerabilities within their technology infrastructure and promptly deploy measures to preclude potential cyber disruptions</p>

                    <p>In response to these concerns, the insurer instigated a comprehensive VAPT drive designed to unearth vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact if exploited by malicious actors. This activity unfolded in three key stages. Firstly, an initial assessment was conducted to identify existing vulnerabilities. Subsequently, a remediation phase was undertaken to rectify these vulnerabilities. Lastly, a confirmatory scan was performed to validate the effectiveness of the remediation measures on the identified vulnerabilities. </p>

                    <p>The initial VAPT scan unveiled the presence of 40 vulnerabilities, which collectively posed a staggering Value at Risk of approximately INR 14.40 Crores concerning potential cyberattacks. Swift action was taken to prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities, ultimately reducing the Value at Risk to approximately INR 4.3 Crores. This marked a remarkable 70% reduction in the overall Value at Risk, effectively fortifying the organization against potential threats.</p>
