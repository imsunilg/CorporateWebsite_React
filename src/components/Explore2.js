India ranks <b style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>3rd globally</b> in vulnerability to these phishing campaigns. Shockingly, <b style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>nearly 5 lakh individuals have fallen prey</b> to such scams, and a staggering <b style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>53% of organizations</b> in India have suffered from the <b style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>harmful impacts of phishing attacks.</b>
